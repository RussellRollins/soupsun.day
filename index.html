            <h2>What</h2>
            <p>
              Soup Sunday is an open invitation dinner party held every week (I
              mean, within reason, the sign-up sheet should have additional
              information if I need to skip a week).

            <h2>Who</h2>
            <p>
              If you found this page and know who Russell is, you're invited.
              It's an open invitation, feel free to bring a friend.

            <p>
              I...look how many more times could this website say "Sunday"? 7pm
              ET.
